# Sort Spectacle: Visualization of Sorting Algorithms

**Sort Spectacle** is an interactive web-based tool designed to help users understand and explore sorting algorithms. With real-time visualizations, users can see how different sorting algorithms behave, observing key operations like comparisons, swaps, and element movements.

## Features

- **Algorithms Supported:**
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Heap Sort

- **Real-time Visualizations:** Watch as the algorithms sort through the data, with animations depicting each step of the sorting process.

- **Adjustable Speed:** Control the speed of the visualizations to better analyze and understand each sorting algorithm's process.

- **Educational Tool:** Useful for students and educators looking to reinforce the understanding of algorithmic concepts through hands-on, visual experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:**
  - HTML5
  - CSS3
  - JavaScript (for algorithm implementation and UI controls)

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Mrunmaimg/Sort-Spectacle-Visualization-of-Sorting-Algorithms.git
    cd Sort-Spectacle-Visualization-of-Sorting-Algorithms
    ```

2. **Open the `index.html` file** in your preferred web browser:
    ```bash
    open index.html
    ```

3. **Select a sorting algorithm** from the menu.

4. **Set the speed:** Adjust the speed using the slider to see each step of the algorithm clearly.

5. **Watch the algorithm in action** as it sorts the data, with each step visualized in real-time.

## Sorting Algorithms Explained

- **Bubble Sort:** A simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
  
- **Selection Sort:** This algorithm repeatedly selects the smallest element from the unsorted portion of the list and swaps it with the first unsorted element.
  
- **Insertion Sort:** Builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It works by comparing each new item to the ones already sorted, inserting it in the correct position.

- **Merge Sort:** A divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits the list into halves, recursively sorts each half, and then merges them back together.
  
- **Quick Sort:** Another divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a "pivot" element and partitions the array around the pivot, sorting the elements recursively.

- **Heap Sort:** Utilizes a binary heap structure to sort elements. It first builds a heap from the input data, then repeatedly extracts the maximum element and rebuilds the heap.

## Future Improvements

- **Additional Sorting Algorithms:**
  - Radix Sort
  - Bucket Sort
  - Shell Sort

- **Enhanced UI:**
  - More customization options for the visualizations.
  - Responsive design for better compatibility with different devices.

- **In-depth Analysis:**
  - Include detailed descriptions of each algorithm's time and space complexity.
  - Provide performance comparisons between algorithms with various data sets.
