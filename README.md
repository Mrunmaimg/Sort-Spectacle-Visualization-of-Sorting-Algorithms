Sort Spectacle: Sorting Algorithm Visualizer
Sort Spectacle is an interactive web-based tool designed to help users understand and explore sorting algorithms. With real-time visualizations, users can see how different sorting algorithms behave, observing key operations like comparisons, swaps, and element movements.

Features
Algorithms Supported:

Bubble Sort
Selection Sort
Insertion Sort
Merge Sort
Quick Sort
Heap Sort
Real-time Visualizations: Watch as the algorithms sort through the data, with animations depicting each step of the sorting process.

Adjustable Speed: Control the speed of the visualizations to better analyze and understand each sorting algorithm's process.

Educational Tool: Useful for students and educators looking to reinforce the understanding of algorithmic concepts through hands-on, visual experience.

Technologies Used
Frontend:
HTML5
CSS3
JavaScript (for algorithm implementation and UI controls)
How to Use
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
https://github.com/Mrunmaimg/Sort-Spectacle-Visualization-of-Sorting-Algorithms.git
cd Sort-Spectacle-Visualization-of-Sorting-Algorithms
Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser:

bash
Copy code
open index.html
Select a sorting algorithm from the menu.

Set the speed: Adjust the speed using the slider to see each step of the algorithm clearly.

Watch the algorithm in action as it sorts the data, with each step visualized in real-time.

Sorting Algorithms Explained
Bubble Sort: A simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

Selection Sort: This algorithm repeatedly selects the smallest element from the unsorted portion of the list and swaps it with the first unsorted element.

Insertion Sort: Builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It works by comparing each new item to the ones already sorted, inserting it in the correct position.

Merge Sort: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits the list into halves, recursively sorts each half, and then merges them back together.

Quick Sort: Another divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a "pivot" element and partitions the array around the pivot, sorting the elements recursively.

Heap Sort: Utilizes a binary heap structure to sort elements. It first builds a heap from the input data, then repeatedly extracts the maximum element and rebuilds the heap.

Future Improvements
Add more sorting algorithms, such as Radix Sort, Bucket Sort, etc.
Enhance the UI with more customization options for the visualizations.
Include in-depth descriptions of each algorithm's time and space complexity.
